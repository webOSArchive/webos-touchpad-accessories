# usbctl-watchd - USB control watch daemon for com.webosarchive.usbsettings
#
# Runs as ROOT outside the webOS app jail (via upstart). The jailed app can't
# touch /sys or mount, so its JS service writes one-word commands to the control
# file and this daemon performs them, writing current state back to the status
# file. IPC lives in /media/internal (the only path shared by jail + system).
#
#   control : /media/internal/.usbctl-control   (app -> daemon, consumed once)
#   status  : /media/internal/.usbctl-status    (daemon -> app, JSON, ~1s fresh)
#   state   : /media/internal/.usbctl-state     (daemon's own persisted flags)
#
# Commands: otg-host otg-peripheral power-on power-off mount unmount refresh

# The root fs (and thus /media) is mounted READ-ONLY on a stock device, so we

# PERFORMANCE, and why this file is written the way it is (measured 2026-07-29):
# every `$(...)` command substitution forks a subshell -- even around a pure
# shell function -- and busybox `cat`/`grep`/`cut`/`dirname`/`date` each fork and
# exec. The original helpers used those on the 1 Hz loop path, so this idle
# daemon forked ~20 processes EVERY SECOND: measured at 114 jiffies of CPU per
# 10 s (~11% of a core) arriving as a ~110 ms burst once a second. That is
# invisible on the desktop but it stole frames from games -- SDL Quake went from
# a steady 50 ms frame time to a 200-450 ms stall every single second, and the
# stutter tracked this daemon exactly (stopping it made the stall vanish).
# So: the idle path below uses SHELL BUILTINS ONLY -- `read` instead of `cat`,
# parameter expansion instead of `dirname`/`basename`, cached variables instead
# of re-reading the state file. Forks are allowed only on paths that run when
# something actually changed. Keep it that way.

# One-shot ARM of the OTG controller (validated 2026-07-29 on a stock device):
# writing "host" ONCE flips a persistent controller state -- from then on (even
# across reboots) the port follows the ID pin: OTG cable in -> host mode +
# enumerate (~0.6s), cable out -> peripheral/gadget. A NEVER-armed device, by
# contrast, hard-hangs its USB port on OTG cable insert until reboot. So arming
# early is a safety fix, not just convenience. We arm only when the port is
# IDLE (no PC/charger gadget connection) because the write force-switches to
# host and would kill an active novacom/charge session mid-use.
# Once armed this costs a single builtin test per loop -- keep that fast path.
